#### Killing Orcs!

This is my first piece of code using Clojure. I'm reading a book called "Clojure for the Brave and True" and this is an example from there. It's a really simple example and I tried to reproduce myself. The example can be found in chapter 3 of the book. I change to hit Orcs instead of Hobbit (i like Hobbits).

**I'm very excited to join in the clojurists world.**

See ya!
